As seen in Fig 1, max temperature seems to have a negative correlation with distance from the equator. 
The graph resembles that of a negative quadratic function (upside down parabola). This coincides with 
the scientific fact that temperatures are higher near the equator due to the spherical shape of the earth. 
Though it is not linear, the negative and positive slopes of the trendlines for the northern and southern 
hemispheres, respectively, further supports this. The northern hemisphere plot also has the highest r-value 
of the bunch, despite not following a very linear trend, instilling confidence in these results. Though 
the southern hemisphere's r-value is much lower, the data only goes from latitudes 0 to -50 (30 degrees 
less than that of the northern hemisphere plot), and once again, the correlation is not linear.

As seen in Fig 2, the correlation between humidity and latitude is slim to none. Both regression lines 
have slightly positive slopes, but the data points are much more scattered, indicated by low r-values. 
It might be more appropriate to compare humidity by region, as humidity often correlates with proximity 
to water.

As seen in Fig 3, there is even less correlation between latitude and cloudiness. The scatter plot looks 
like chaos with no discernable trends. The linear regression plots confirm this with measly r-values of 
0.15 and 0.42. This is not a relationship worth studying.   

As seen in Fig 4, this comparison takes the cake, not in a good way. Wind speed is pretty much even across 
latitudes. There really aren't any trends that could scraped together from this data. The linear regression 
plot for the northern hemisphere has an r-value of 0.06! There's not much else to be said.
